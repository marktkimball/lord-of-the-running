###Lord of the Running

Lord of the Running is a web application to gamify the user's real-world running experiences. The game is based on J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings trilogy and follows the storyline and journey of Frodo.

Once a user joins, they will be asked to link their Strava account to Lord of the Running and begin the quest.  From the date of joining, runs completed in the real-world and synced with Strava will be pulled into the user's Lord of the Running account at login.  Depending on the difficulty level set by the user, the real-world miles will be mapped in Middle Earth at a set ratio (i.e. 1:10, 1:5, etc.).

Users can compete against each other to reach the top stops on the leaderboards and lay claim to various accomplishments and become Lord of the Running.



Lord of the Running was my final project at The Iron Yard and is my largest programming accomplishment to date.  The application uses AngularJS for all the front-end and the remainder of the MEAN stack to round out the back-end.  The Strava authentication uses OAuth2 protocol.
